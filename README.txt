This is the Corey Ross repository for Comp20: Web Programming class at Tufts University.

My favorite assignment would have to be the duckhunt assignment, because it was fun to draw
the different images to the canvas using different tool.

I am most proud of my gamecenter-2048 heroku app, because it was a lot of work but paid off.
It is easy to see how this app could be used in real life, and is using some features that
are relatively new in terms of database storage and server-side.

I think I have grown a lot as a programmer from this class, in both my web skills and in a more
general sense. I can now more comfortably debug, and I understand programming languages more
easily than before.
