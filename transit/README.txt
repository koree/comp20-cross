Leaving for San Diego on Wednesday night, got done what I could beforehand.
As of right now, everything I've implemented seems to work. Didn't include arrival times etc. 
No polyline right now.

Worked alone on project.

Thanks to Ming Chow, and TAs Jasper and Connor for their time.

So far, ~10 hours worked on this project.
