Web Security - Corey Ross

Everything seems to be implemented correctly.

Worked with Raewyn Duvall - she was my assigned partner.
	She let me know if my MongoLab attacks went through or not

~5.5 hours spent on this assignment 

Thanks to https://code.google.com/p/html5security/wiki/CrossOriginRequestSecurity and https://github.com/theSmaw/Caja-HTML-Sanitizer
	for the code help in my suggestions.
