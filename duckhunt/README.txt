Duckhunt JavaScript 

-Everything seems to be on the page as requested in the assignment. No known issues.

-Now in V2, code much cleaner and easier by using entire bottom of png image in the page,
	rather than each element separately. (Now grass, dirt, and bushes connected as one image,
	where before they were all separate images forced together.)

-Worked alone, learned techniques from Mozilla Development page.

-Roughly ~2.5 hours spent so far on project.
